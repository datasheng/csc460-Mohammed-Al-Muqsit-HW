It helps investors compare stock prices with previous prices to determine market performance.\n\nIn this project you are provided with two CSV files containing Nasdaq-100 stock information:\n- _**nasdaq100_CA.csv**_: contains information about companies in the index such as symbol, name, etc. For this analysis, only companies headquartered in California have been selected.\n- _**nasdaq100_price_change.csv**_: contains price changes per stock across periods including (but not limited to) one day, five days, one month, six months, one year, etc.\n\nAs an AI developer, you will leverage the OpenAI API to classify companies into sectors and produce a summary of sector and company performance for this year, for the companies in the index that are headquartered in California.","metadata":{},"id":"c36c709e-8395-48d2-8a18-918cd2df89a9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# CSV with Nasdaq-100 stock data\n\nIn this project, you have available two CSV files
